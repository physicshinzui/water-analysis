# Analysis of Water Dynamics 

This set of programs is a tool for the analysis of water dynamics.
It gives:
- survival probabilities of water molecules in a user-defined space
- atom indexes of water molecules that stay for a long simulation time. 
- view of these water molecules bound strongly via PyMOL
